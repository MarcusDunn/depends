# depends
A Kotlin implementation of the [First order dependent type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) as described in [*A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus*](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/LambdaPi.pdf)
by Andres Loh, Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra

It has  the implementation for Natural Numbers and length-perameterized vectors. As there is no way to have user defined data types, this is mostly usless, but a interesting look at the most basic implementation of dependant types.
